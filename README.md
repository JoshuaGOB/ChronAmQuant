# ChronAmQuant
These materials form a two-part, robust-yet-introductory workshop on text analysis of [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) newspapers in R.

The first part introduces strategies for fuzzy string matching, using the OCR-derived text from the *Perth Amboy Evening News*. The second part begins with the results of the previous and explores a few possible methods for analyzing phrase use over time, page location, collocate words, and uniqueness.

These workshops were originally offered during April 2018 at Rutgers University-New Brunswick at Alexander Library.

## File Guide
**ChronAm_Workshop_1.pdf** and **ChronAm_Workshop_2.pdf**
Knitted .pdf files of all code, sample outputs, and figures.

**ChronAm Workshop 1.Rmd** and **ChronAm Workshop 2.Rmd**
Master .Rmd files, used to generate .pdf files.

**ChronAm Workshop 1 for Users.Rmd** and **ChronAm Workshop 2 Users.Rmd**
These .Rmd files are best for user participation. They are largely the same as the master .Rmd files, but some additional instructions have been added to help prompt users when to edit code and some of the additional demonstrations from the master .rmd files have been removed for simplicity.

**/Sample Data**
Several .csv files of search results from Workshop 1 available for use in Workshop 2.

**/Page Images**
The newspaper images used in the .pdf and master .Rmd files.
