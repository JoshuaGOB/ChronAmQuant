# ChronAmQuant
These materials are from a two-part workshop on text analysis of Chronicling America newspapers in R, intended to cover considerable ground while still remaining accessible to participants with no coding experience. 

The first workshop introduces strategies for fuzzy string matching, using the OCR-derived text from the *Perth Amboy Evening News*. The second workshop begins with the results of the previous and explores a few possible methods for analyzing phrase use over time, page location, collocate words, and uniqueness.

These workshops were originally offered during April 2018 at Rutgers University-New Brunswick at Alexander Library. 

## File Guide
**ChronAm_Workshop_1.pdf** and **ChronAm_Workshop_2.pdf**
Knitted .pdf files of all code and sample outputs.

**ChronAm Workshop 1.Rmd** and **ChronAm Workshop 2.Rmd**
Master .Rmd files, used to generate .pdf files.

**ChronAm Workshop 1 for Users.Rmd** and **ChronAm Workshop 2 Users.Rmd**
These .Rmd files are best for user participation. They are largely the same as the master .rmd files, but some additional instructions have been added to help prompt users when to edit code and some of the additional demonstrations from the master .rmd files have been removed for simplicity.

**/Sample Data**
Several .csv files of search results from Workshop 1 for use in Workshop 2.

**/Images**
Several newspaper images used in the .pdf and master .Rmd files.
